# Flower Predictor
A Machine Learning model to classify various flower types based on the Iris Dataset using Decision Tree Classification.<br>
This project was made by [Abdul Kadir](https://github.com/AK3847) for the Internship at *Coding Samurai*

## How to use: 
- Clone the repository
  
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AK3847/Flower-Species-Prediction.git
```
- Navigate to the main folder and install the requirements:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements
```
- Run the main.py file:
```bash
  python main.py
```
- Either train a new model or use a pre-trained model:

- You can import a pre-trained model which should be in _.joblib_ format
- You can also find accuracy of the trained model:
